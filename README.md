Hi! This is my personal website (currently underconstruction)

Ideas/To Do
    1)Projects
        i) Create "Project Icons" which have an image, a url, and a title. In the future, add a categories property so that users can filter projects based on a catgeory (like software, electrical, etc)
        ii)Projects page should be a grid of project icons. After the base of the projects is implemented, add a "filter bar" UI tool below the navbar/on the side which lets users filter projects by category, or by date/alphabetical
    2) Notes
        i)  Notes page would be a simple unorder list of notes that I have taken while studying different engineering and non engineering concepts and ideas. Could be (and not limited to) notes about databases, transistors, the internet, how to build a computer, biology etc.
        ii) List of titles of notes that take the user to the expanded note with details. Later, implement a filter function similar to projects. (lower priority)
